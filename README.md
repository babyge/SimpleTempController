This is a simple temperature controller based on an Arduino that is intended to be used with an improvised dry heat disinfection unit that operates at 60 to 100 C.  The disinfection unit uses a small metal bucket and lid as the disinfection chamber and incandescent light bulbs as the heating elements which should be available at hardware stores.  The unit is designed to be readily constructible for use in a crisis or pandemic situation where dry heat disinfection is applied to personal protective equipment (PPE).

It is intentionally simple, requiring the minimum specialized parts, so it can be built with parts that are on-hand or readily available.  The main specialized parts are an Arduino Nano or Arduino Uno and a LM35 temperature sensing IC.  The user interface is four LEDs and three push buttons.  A PCB layout is available for a version that uses the Arduino Nano V3.  The PCB is one-sided an a stencil is provided for etching a circuit board.  Because the disinfection unit uses mains power, precautions should be taken to prevent electric shock.
